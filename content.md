# Job Overview 🧾
![](img/job_start.png)
Select existing system and target upgrade path.

- See photo – current boiler & cylinder
- Electrical isolation confirmed
- Loft access check – WAH

## Current System 🌡️
![](img/regular_schematic.png)
> Identify what’s installed today.

- Regular (open vented) – F&E in loft
- Cylinder: copper vented – see photo
- Controls: Y-Plan (3-port)
- Flue: horizontal rear exit
- See photo – airing cupboard & tank
- Electrical socket near boiler – electrical
- Loft ladder steep (over 6 m) – WAH

### Existing Issues
![](img/regular_issues.png)
- Low system pressure / noisy pump
- Radiators cold at top – sludge suspected
- Asbestos board behind boiler – asbestos
- See photo – suspected ACM
- Recommend powerflush before upgrade

# Proposed System 🌱
![](img/system_schematic.png)
> Conversion to sealed system (Ideal Logic System 24 kW)

- System type: Sealed / pressurised – no F&E tank
- PRV & filling loop to be added
- Auto-bypass included
- Remote PRV discharge route – see photo
- External condensate run < 3 m – insulated

## Selected Boiler 🔥
![](img/ideal_logic_system.png)
**Ideal Logic System 24 kW**  
Case 700 × 395 × 278 mm  
Clearances: Above 165 mm / Below 100 mm / Sides 2.5 mm / Front 450 mm  
No compartment ventilation required.  
Remote PRV option = Yes  |  Frost stat required = Yes.  [oai_citation:0‡Ideal System Boiler Quick Reference Guide.pdf](file-service://file-CqAVshc2bViiUu9nrhba1u)

- See photo – proposed wall & spur
- Electrical spur ≤ 500 mm from boiler – electrical
- Document: “Existing system open-vented → sealed conversion; customer informed of potential leak risk.” ration 💨
![](img/horizontal_flue.png)
> Horizontal flue through rear wall

- Distance to opening ≥ 300 mm
- Distance to boundary ≥ 600 mm
- Facing another outlet ≥ 1200 mm
- Corner clearance (Ideal) = 25 mm reduction allowed once only per install.  [oai_citation:1‡DTG-July-24.pdf](file-service://file-N7qe1wk9ksG1A3xkdcJhje)etre back to boiler; support every 1 m of run.  [oai_citation:2‡DTG-July-24.pdf](file-service://file-N7qe1wk9ksG1A3xkdcJhje)al termination

# Gas Supply 🔥
![](img/gas_pipework.png)
> Confirm pipe sizing & route

- Existing 22 mm run ≈ 10 m → OK for 24 kW system boiler.  
- Meter type = U6 (acity.  
- Route: under stairs cupboard → kitchenlead or galvanised sections – none found
- Gas tightness test recorded

---

# Condensate 🧊
![](img/condensate_run.png)
> External run to trapped gully

- 40 mm insulated pipe (Condensulate type)
- Fall ≥ 50 mm/m back to boiler
- Terminate with non-return trap + guard at gully
- Length < 3 m → no trace heat required
- See photo – external termination
- Add frost protection pack if run extended later.

# Cylinder Replacement ⚙️
![](img/unvented_cylinder.pnged + F&E tank, fit unvented 170 L cylinder.

- Include expansion vessel and safety valve set
- PRV discharge to external wall (visible termination)
- Pipe upgrade to 22 mm primaries (min)
- Document additional hour for open-vent removal pack (P0039).  [oai_citation:3‡Ideal System Boiler Quick Reference Guide.pdf](file-service://file-CqAVshc2bViiUu9nrhba1u)
- See photo – new cylinder location

# Extras & Best Practice ➕
![](img/extras.png)
> Optional add-ons / packages

## Powerflush & Filter
![](img/filter.png)
- Full powerflush pre-install → flush and protector added.  [oai_citation:4‡DTG-July-24.pdf](file-service://file-N7qe1wk9ksG1A3xkdcJhje)
- Fit Fernox TF1 Omega filter under boiler return leg (brass  photo – filter fitment

## Controls & Commissioning

- nnel 1 heating / channel 2 cylinder
- TRVs throughout (rooms except bypass)
- See photo – control location
